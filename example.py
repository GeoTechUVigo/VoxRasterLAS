"""
Function to calculate for all clouds in cloud_path, which trajectory points are related to that cloud
In other words, which trajectory points are inside of its limits XY, or inside in X and closer than max_distance
to its Y limits, or vise versa, or closer than max_distance to its min_x and min_y or max_y or vise versa.

:param cloud_path: folder with the point clouds.
:param trajectory: trajectory points with XYZ in the first 3 columns.
:param max_distance: max distance between a trajectory point and a point cloud considered.
:return: boolean numpy matrix nº trajectory points x nº clouds. True if that points is closer than max_distance to the
cloud. Points clouds are sorted alphabetically.
