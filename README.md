# VoxRasterLAS
This library rasterises and voxelises 3D point clouds. It takes a laspy object as input and performs feature extraction.

## Overview
This library rasterises and voxelises laspy objects, performing feature extraction at the raster and voxel level, respectively.
To speed up the process, operations are performed using GPUs with the Numba library.

### Voxelisation
 Takes the laspy object and return a Voxel object which contains the following properties:
 - voxel_size:  size of voxel.
 - neighbours:  Nx26 numpy.ma.core.MaskedArray with the index row in las.xyz of the neighbours of each voxel.
 - parent_idx: Mx1 numpy.array. M is the number of points in the original point cloud. The value of each point is the index of the voxelised point cloud to which it belongs. The index is the position in the array las.xyz. -1 value means that point is not in the voxelised point cloud.
 - eig: Nx3 numpy array of eigenvalues. Result of PCA at voxel level.
 - eiv: Nx3x3 numpy array of eigenvectors. Result of PCA at voxel level.
 - grid:  NxMxW occupation grid.
 - indexes_grid: Nx3 grid indexes_grid of self.las points.
 - las: laspy object with the voxelised point cloud. New fields are created containing the features extractured to each field of the laspy object. The features are:
    - mean
    - mode
    - variance
    - centroid
    - random selection

and the method:
- get_parent_idx: returns a boolean array with True in those points in the original point cloud that are in any voxel specified in indexes.

### Rasterisation
 Takes the laspy object and return a Raster object which contains the following properties:
 - pixel_size: size of pixel.
 - parent_idx: Mx1 numpy.array. M is the number of points in the original point cloud. The value of each point is the index of the pixelised image point cloud to which it belongs.
 - feature: MxN raster that contain the feature extracted at pixel level to each field of the point cloud. The features are:
   - occupation
   - minimum
   - maximum
   - variance
   - mode

  and the method:
  - get_parent_idx: returns a boolean array with True in those points in the original point cloud that are in any voxel specified in indexes.

## Installation
This package can also be used with and without NUMBA package version 0.57. To use with NUMBA, Nvidia drivers and CUDA SDK must be preinstalled (check numba instructions https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/installing.html):

LAS decompressor might be installed via pip compatible with laspy package.

To install VoxRasterLAS (available in pip):
```
python3 -m pip install VoxRasterLAS==0.1.0
```
